HMWP2-Cy2 Low-Frequency Vibrational Normal Modes
================================================

The directories below are listed in roughly chronological order of their use in preparing the
HMWP2-Cy2 model for low-frequency vibrational normal mode calculations, performing the normal
mode calculation, and displaying the results. Each entry is formatted as:

Directory/File: [Name]
- Description

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Directory: model_preparation
-	This directory contains subdirectories and files containing relevant structures, run files,
	and output for HMWP2-Cy2 model preparation for calculation of low-frequency vibrational normal
	modes.

Directory: low_mode_calculation
-	This directory contains the run files and output (*out.mae.gz) from the normal mode
	calculation for the prepared HMWP2-Cy2 model. Note that mode in the output file is comprised
	of 80 frames. There are 10 modes reported, for a total of 800 models in the output file. The
	.com file can be used to display the vibrations in BioLuminate.

Directory: low_mode_videos
-	This directory contains the videos of the vibrational normal modes rendered using PyMOL.
