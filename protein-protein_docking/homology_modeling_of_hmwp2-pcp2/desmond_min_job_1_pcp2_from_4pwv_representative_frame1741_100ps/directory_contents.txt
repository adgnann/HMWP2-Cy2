HMWP2-PCP2 Homology Model Preparation for Protein-Protein Docking
=================================================================

The files and directories below are listed in roughly chronological order of their use in preparing
the HMWP2-PCP2 model for protein-protein docking at the downstream tunnel entrance of HMWP2-Cy2.

Each entry is formatted as:

Directory/File: [Name]
- Description

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Directory: homology_model_based_on_4pwv/
-	This directory contains files produced by the Advanced Homology Modeling tool in BioLuminate
	in generation of an initial homology model of HMWP2-PCP2 based on PDB ID 4PWV. The original
	versions of these files were overwritten, but the output from the process in the included
	files has been compared for strict consistency with the output from the previous workup.
	* The BLAST results are available in "prime_blast_run1_Tmp_23Mar2022_2039_43048.out" although
	  they are not in a particularly human readable format. We performed comparable calculations
	  with other PCP models (PDB IDs 4zxi, 6VTJ and 7KW0) but chose to report the 4PWV-based model
	  based on its low number of non-template loops to model (only 1), relatively high sequence
	  ID, and performance in docking.
	* The secondary structure prediction for the query is in:
	  "prime_ssp_run1_Tmp_23Mar2022_2039_43048.out"
	* The alignment of query to template (4PWV) is in
	  "prime_clustal_align_run1_Tmp_23Mar2022_2039_43048_out.fasta"
	* The energy-based model building files begin with:
	  "prime_bldstruct_run1_Tmp_23Mar2022_2039_43048"
	  When loaded in PyMOL or BioLuminate, the output:
	  "prime_bldstruct_run1_Tmp_23Mar2022_2039_43048-out.mae"
	  will display the color coding:
		Blue  --  Full residue conformation is copied from the template
		          Identical residues at this position in the alignment
		Cyan  --  Residue Backbone Conformation is copied from the template
		          Sidechain mutation at this position in the alignment
		Red   --  Residue backbone and sidechain positions have been modeled
		          An insertion, deletion or experimental constraint requires
		          this position in the alignment to be predicted
	  as listed at the end of the file:
	  "prime_bldstruct_run1_Tmp_23Mar2022_2039_43048.log"
	* pfam and ssa files are inconsequential for the results.
	* Note that the output model required repairing the serine-phosphate bond, and the protein
	  termini were neutralized as an aldehyde and amine prior to the loop refinement documented
	  in the next directory.

Directory: prime_loops_7_4pwv_advanced_energy-based_w_kh4_neut_term_nontemplate_loop_only_default_sampling
-	This directory contains the run files and output from Prime refinement of the non-template
	loop in the initial homology model.

File: preparation_of_phosphoserine_4pwv-based_hmwp2-pcp2_homology_model.maegz
-	This file contains models from preparation of the model in which the pantetheine cofactor of
	the loop-refined initial homology model was truncated to phosphate. In order, the models are:
	* The initial loop-refined model
	* The output from preprocessing in the BioLuminate Protein Preparation Wizard (*_preprocessed),
	  which includes hydrogen atoms, charge assignment, and correct bond orders.
	* Output from hydrogen-bond optimization in the Protein Preparation Wizard (*_hbond-opt)
	* Output from potential energy minimization of hydrogen coordinates in Impact in the Protein
	  Preparation Wizard (*_H-minimized)
	* Output from the potential energy minimziation of all atomic coordinates in Impact in the
	  Protein Preparation Wizard, with the minimization truncated in the step before heavy atom
	  RMSDs reached 0.3 Angstrom (*_H-minimized_-_minimized)

Directory: desmond_setup_9_pcp2-SEP_based_on_4pwv_final_10ang_buff_9na_neut_150mm_nacl
-	This directory contains the run files and output for setting up the model system for MD
	simulation in Desmond.

Directory: desmond_md_job_7_4pwv_final_relax_then_10ns_at_300k_w_5ps_slices
-	This directory contains each stage of the default NPT ensemble relaxation protocol employed
	by Desmond MD in BioLuminate. The production run is in:
	"desmond_md_job_7_4pwv_final_relax_then_10ns_at_300k_w_5ps_slices-out.cms"
	and the associated *_trj/ directory
	* The production run is conducted at a temperature of 300 K (Nose-Hoover chain
	  thermostatting with 1 ps relaxation) and a pressure of 1.01325 bar (Martyna-Tobias-Klein
	  with 2 ps relaxation and isotropic coupling) in the NPT ensemble.
	* These MD simulations were performed using an NVidia GeForce RTX 2060.
	* Frame 1,741 from the production run was selected as a representative state based on its
	  having the lowest RMSD relative to an average structure from the last 1,000 frames of
	  the trajectory.

Directory: desmond_setup_12_pcp2-SEP_based_on_4pwv_representative_frame_1741_for_desmond_min
-	This directory contains the run files and output from model system generation for the
	representative frame 1,741. This is required to have a system on which to perform the
	Desmond minimization protocol in the next directory.

Directory: desmond_min_job_1_pcp2_from_4pwv_representative_frame1741_100ps
-	This directory contains the default Desmond minimization of the representative model from
	frame 1,741 of the production run.

File: preparation_of_desmond-minimized_representative_frame_1741.maegz
-	This file contains the protein model from the final frame of Desmond minimization:
	"Model_of_ybt-pcp2 . . ."
	then preprocessing, hydrogen-bond optimization, hydrogen coordinate minimization and
	all-atom minimization (truncated before heavy atom RMSDs reached 0.3 Angstrom) models of the
	same type as listed for:
	"preparation_of_phosphoserine_4pwv-based_hmwp2-pcp2_homology_model.maegz"
	* The final model was used as input into HADDOCK2.4 for protein-protein docking.
