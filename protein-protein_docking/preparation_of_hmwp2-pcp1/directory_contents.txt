HMWP2-PCP1 Model Preparation for Protein-Protein Docking
========================================================

The files and directories below are listed in roughly chronological order of their use in preparing
the HMWP2-PCP1 model for protein-protein docking at the upstream tunnel entrance of HMWP2-Cy2.

Each entry is formatted as:

Directory/File: [Name]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

File: preparing_hmwp2-pcp1_nmr_bundle_representative.maegz
-   This file contains models from steps used to prepare the initial HMWP2-PCP1 model with
    phosphoserine. The models are:
	* The NMR bundle representative from PDB ID 5U3H, model 1 (*_representative)
	* The output from preprocessing in the BioLuminate Protein Preparation Wizard (*_preprocessed),
	  which includes hydrogen atoms, charge assignment, and correct bond orders.
	* Output from hydrogen-bond optimization in the Protein Preparation Wizard (*_hbond-opt)
	* Output from potential energy minimization of hydrogen coordinates in Impact in the Protein
	  Preparation Wizard (*_H-minimized)
	* Output from the potential energy minimziation of all atomic coordinates in Impact in the
	  Protein Preparation Wizard, with the minimization truncated in the step before heavy atom
	  RMSDs reached 0.3 Angstrom (*_H-minimized_-_minimized)
    * The model with a phosphate installed at the Ppant attachment site (*_w_phosphoserine)
    * The phosphoserine model preprocessed using the Protein Preparation Wizard
      (*_w_phosphoserine_preprocessed)

Directory: prime_mini_1_pcp1-phosphoserine-only/
-	This directory contains run files and output from Prime refinement of the phosphoserine of the
    prepared NMR bundle representative.

File: preparing_hmwp2-pcp1_nmr_bundle_representative_after_phosphoserine_refinement.maegz
-   This file contains models from steps used to prepare the refined phosphoserine model from
    prime_mini_1_pcp1-phosphoserine-only. The models are:
    * Output from hydrogen-bond optimization in the Protein Preparation Wizard (*_hbond-opt)
	* Output from potential energy minimization of hydrogen coordinates in Impact in the Protein
	  Preparation Wizard (*_H-minimized)
	* Output from the potential energy minimziation of all atomic coordinates in Impact in the
	  Protein Preparation Wizard, with the minimization truncated in the step before heavy atom
	  RMSDs reached 0.3 Angstrom (*_H-minimized_-_minimized)

Files: new_final_pcp1_model.pdb, new_final_pcp1_model_hisonly.pdb, new_final_pcp1_model_hisonly_haddocksep.pdb
-   These files show the steps to prepare the complete phosphoserine-modified NMR-bundle representative
    for input into HADDOCK. "new_final_pcp1_model_hisonly_haddocksep.pdb" has all histidines defined
    as "his" residues, and the atom naming for the phosphoserine "SEP" is as expected by HADDOCK
