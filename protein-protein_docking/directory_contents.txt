HMWP2-PCP1 and HMWP2-PCP2 Protein-Protein Docking
=================================================

The directories below are listed in roughly chronological order of their use in preparing and docking
HMWP2-PCP1 and HMWP2-PCP2 models using HADDOCK2.4.

Each entry is formatted as:

Directory/File: [Name]
- Description

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Directory: homology_modeling_of_hmwp2-pcp2
-   This directory contains files for preparing the HMWP2-PCP2 homology model with a phosphoserine.

Directory: preparation_of_hmwp2-pcp1
-   This directory contains files for preparing the HMWP2-PCP1 NMR bundle representative model with a
    phosphoserine

Directory: docking_hmwp2-pcp1
-   This directory contains HADDOCK2.4 run files and output (.tar.gz) from docking HMWP2-PCP1. Note
    that information on docked clusters can be viewed in the index.html file. This webpage loads with
    a "HADDOCK2.2" banner despite the fact that the run was conducted in HADDOCK2.4. The model
    presented in Fig. 3 of the paper is cluster 11 pose 2, which was selected for its high similarity
    to the reference CP-C(y) complexes in terms of relative positioning of the domains as well as the
    cluster's favorable metrics:

        HADDOCK score 	-196.6 +/- 27.4
        Cluster size 	4
        RMSD from the overall lowest-energy structure 	6.9 +/- 0.1
        Van der Waals energy 	-44.5 +/- 11.7
        Electrostatic energy 	-168.9 +/- 43.6
        Desolvation energy 	-8.3 +/- 3.5
        Restraints violation energy 	46.6 +/- 0.99
        Buried Surface Area 	1470.3 +/- 204.3
        Z-Score 	-1.4 

    Plots of metrics for each cluster/pose are in plots.tgz. Cluster 11 pose 2 is "complex_167," which
    is similar in quality to cluster 8 (top-ranked cluster) poses.

Directory: docking_hmwp2-pcp2
-   This directory contains HADDOCK2.4 run files and output (.tar.gz) from docking HMWP2-PCP2. Note
    that information on docked clusters can be viewed in the index.html file. This webpage loads with
    a "HADDOCK2.2" banner despite the fact that the run was conducted in HADDOCK2.4. The model
    presented in Fig. 3 of the paper is cluster 2 pose 1, which was selected for its high similarity
    to the reference CP-C(y) complexes in terms of relative positioning of the domains as well as the
    cluster's favorable metrics:

        HADDOCK score 	-183.2 +/- 6.5
        Cluster size 	34
        RMSD from the overall lowest-energy structure 	6.2 +/- 0.1
        Van der Waals energy 	-37.5 +/- 6.1
        Electrostatic energy 	-194.3 +/- 20.2
        Desolvation energy 	-16.2 +/- 3.3
        Restraints violation energy 	47.9 +/- 0.87
        Buried Surface Area 	1404.9 +/- 88.2
        Z-Score 	-1.3

    Plots of metrics for each cluster/pose are in plots.tgz. Cluster 2 pose 1 is "complex_70." Note
    that the top-ranked cluster, cluster 5, is geometrically highly divergent from expectations based
    on existing C(y)-PCP references.
