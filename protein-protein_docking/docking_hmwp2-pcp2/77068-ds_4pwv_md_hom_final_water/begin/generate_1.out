 RTFRDR>! History: 
 RTFRDR>! Bill Weis 10-July-1988: 
 RTFRDR>! Charges taken from John Brady's glucose topology file for ring, 
 RTFRDR>!   others from protein parameter file. 
 RTFRDR>! Idealized values for impropers at ring carbons to allow simple 
 RTFRDR>!   construction of various anomers/epimers. 
 RTFRDR>! Any other hexose or link can be easily constructed by analogy to these. 
 RTFRDR> 
 RTFRDR>! Additions 6-March-1992 Bill Weis for use with PARAM2.CHO 
 RTFRDR>! New atom types CCA, CCE,  OA for the C1 & O1 positions to account 
 RTFRDR>! for different bond and angle values due to the anomeric effect. 
 RTFRDR>! More accurate equilibrium values for bond angle around this oxygen 
 RTFRDR>! in glycosidic linkages.  CCE for equatorial O1, CCA for 
 RTFRDR>! axial O1.   For free sugar, keep OH1 as O1 atomtype; changed to OA 
 RTFRDR>! for linkages. 
 RTFRDR>! References: G.A. Jeffrey (1990) Acta Cryst B46, 89-103; 
 RTFRDR>! K. Hirotsu & A.Shimada, (1974) Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan, 47, 1872-1879. 
 RTFRDR>! 
 RTFRDR>! Additional CC6 atomtype for exocyclic carbon 5/11/92 
 RTFRDR>! New nomenclature, pairs of anomers for each pyranose sugar, generic links, ATB 12-Dec-2009 
 RTFRDR>! 
 RTFRDR>! added impropers that define anomers using non-hydrogen atoms, ATB 12/06/09 
 RTFRDR>! 
 RTFRDR>! added additional residues: FCA, FCB, A2G, ATB 12/07/09
