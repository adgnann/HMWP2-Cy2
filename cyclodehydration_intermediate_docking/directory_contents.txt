HMWP2-Cy2 Cyclodehydration Intermediate Docking
===============================================

The files and directories below are listed in roughly chronological order of their use in preparing the
cyclodehydration intermediate docking models. Each entry is formatted as:

Directory/File: [Name]
- Description

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Directory: prime_mini_1_neg_dyad_xtal-comp70pcp2_complex_initial_chainC_and_within_5ang_refinement
- The model refinement for the composite model of the HMWP2-Cy2 crystal structure with the reported
  HADDOCK HMWP2-PCP2 pose, used for receptor 1 and receptor 2 (see description of other directories below)

File: Phosphonate_Addition.cdock
- Parameter file for covalent docking in BioLuminate

Directory: covalent_docking_5_receptor_1_no_water_initial_cyclo_int_docking
- Receptor 1 is the HMWP2-Cy2 crystal structure with the reported HADDOCK
  HMWP2-PCP2 pose included by Cy domain alignment. This model was preprocessed
  and H-bond optimized, then the PCP and residues within 5 Angstrom were refined
  using Prime (see files in the directory:
  "prime_mini_1_neg_dyad_xtal-comp70pcp2_complex_initial_chainC_and_within_5ang_refinement")

Directory: covalent_docking_6_receptor_2_no_water_initial_cyclo_int_docking
- Receptor 2 is the HMWP2-Cy2 crystal structure with the reported HADDOCK
  HMWP2-PCP2 pose included by Cy domain alignment. This model was preprocessed
  and H-bond optimized, then the PCP and residues within 5 Angstrom were refined
  using Prime (see files in the directory:
  "prime_mini_1_neg_dyad_xtal-comp70pcp2_complex_initial_chainC_and_within_5ang_refinement")
  Finally, the dyad aspartate was protonated to achieve a neutral active site state.

Directory: covalent_docking_7_receptor_3_no_water_initial_cyclo_int_docking
- Receptor 3 is the HMWP2-Cy2 crystal structure with the reported HADDOCK
  HMWP2-PCP2 pose included by Cy domain alignment. This model was preprocessed
  and H-bond optimized, the dyad aspartate was protonated to achieve a neutral active
  site state, then the PCP and residues within 5 Angstrom were refined using Prime
  (see files in the directory:
  "prime_mini_2_neut_dyad_xtal-comp70pcp2_complex_initial_chainC_and_within_5ang_refinement").

Directory: covalent_docking_8_receptor_4_no_water_initial_cyclo_int_docking
- Receptor 4 is the HMWP2-Cy2 crystal structure with the reported HADDOCK
  HMWP2-PCP2 pose included by Cy domain alignment. This model was preprocessed
  and H-bond optimized, the dyad aspartate was protonated to achieve a neutral active
  site state, then the PCP and residues within 5 Angstrom were refined using Prime
  (see files in the directory:
  "prime_mini_2_neut_dyad_xtal-comp70pcp2_complex_initial_chainC_and_within_5ang_refinement").
  Finally, the dyad aspartate was deprotonated to reinstall a negatively charged active site.
