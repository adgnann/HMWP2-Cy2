HMWP2-Cy2 Cyclodehydration Intermediate Docking
===============================================

The files and directories below are listed in roughly chronological order of their use in preparing
the cyclodehydration intermediate docking models. Each entry is formatted as:

Directory/File: [Name]
- Description

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Directory: prime_mini_1_neg_dyad_xtal-comp70pcp2_complex_initial_chainC_and_within_5ang_refinement
-	The model refinement for the composite model of the completed HMWP2-Cy2 model with the
	reported HADDOCK HMWP2-PCP2 pose, used for receptor 1 and receptor 2 (see description of
	other directories below).

Directory: covalent_docking_runs
-	This directory contains subdirectories for runs of Covalent Docking v1.3 in BioLuminate.

Directory: refinement_runs
-	This directory contains .tar.gz archives containing files from refinement of R and S
	cyclodehydration intermediate poses.

Directory: pymol_sessions_with_docked_poses_and_refinement_steps
-	This directory contains .tar.gz archives containing .pse PyMOL sessions displaying the docked
	poses and refinement steps.

Directory: mm-gbsa_runs
-	This directory contains .tar.gz archives containing files from Prime MM-GBSA runs for the top
	R and S cyclodehydration intermediate poses after refinement.

File: covalent_docking_and_refinement_top_results_table.txt
-	This file contains information from docking, refinement and MM-GBSA analysis of the top
	R and S cyclodehydration intermediate poses reported in the paper. The numbers in the
	leftmost column correspond to numbers in tables reported under the SI figures reporting
	refined docking results.
