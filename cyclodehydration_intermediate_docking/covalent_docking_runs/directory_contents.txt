-	Parameter file for covalent docking in BioLuminate.

Directory: covalent_docking_5_receptor_1_no_water_initial_cyclo_int_docking
-	Receptor 1 is the HMWP2-Cy2 crystal structure with the reported HADDOCK
	HMWP2-PCP2 pose included by Cy domain alignment. This model was preprocessed
	and H-bond optimized, then the PCP and residues within 5 Angstrom were refined
	using Prime (see files in the directory:
	"prime_mini_1_neg_dyad_xtal-comp70pcp2_complex_initial_chainC_and_within_5ang_refinement")
	Models in this run with names containing "o--r" or "o--s" were not used further because of
	unphysical distortions of the oxyanion form of the thiazolidine upon refinement.

Directory: covalent_docking_6_receptor_2_no_water_initial_cyclo_int_docking
-	Receptor 2 is the HMWP2-Cy2 crystal structure with the reported HADDOCK
	HMWP2-PCP2 pose included by Cy domain alignment. This model was preprocessed
	and H-bond optimized, then the PCP and residues within 5 Angstrom were refined
	using Prime (see files in the directory:
	"prime_mini_1_neg_dyad_xtal-comp70pcp2_complex_initial_chainC_and_within_5ang_refinement")
	Finally, the dyad aspartate was protonated to achieve a neutral active site state.
	Models in this run with names containing "o--r" or "o--s" were not used further because of
	unphysical distortions of the oxyanion form of the thiazolidine upon refinement
