File: r_cyclodehydration_intermediate_prime_mini_jobs.tar.gz
-   This archive contains Prime minimization files for the following refinement steps applied to the
    R cyclodehydration intermediate docking poses:
       1) Initial refinement of protein residues within 5 Angstrom of the ligand poses
       2) Subsequent refinement of ligand and residues with 5 Angstrom of it
       3) Refinement of the ligand and residues within 5 Angstrom after sidechain optimization
          (see the next description)

File: r_cyclodehydration_intermediate_prime_sidechain_jobs.tar.gz
-   This archive contains Prime sidechain optimization files for Monte Carlo conformational
    searches of residues surrounding the R cyclodehydration intermediate docking poses after
    refinement through step 2 of the above description. The top 5 steps as determined by energy
    were returned.

File: s_cyclodehydration_intermediate_prime_mini_jobs.tar.gz
-   This archive contains Prime minimization files for the following refinement steps applied to the
    S cyclodehydration intermediate docking poses:
       1) Initial refinement of protein residues within 5 Angstrom of the ligand poses
       2) Subsequent refinement of ligand and residues with 5 Angstrom of it
       3) Refinement of the ligand and residues within 5 Angstrom after sidechain optimization
          (see the next description)

File: s_cyclodehydration_intermediate_prime_sidechain_jobs.tar.gz
-   This archive contains Prime sidechain optimization files for Monte Carlo conformational
    searches of residues surrounding the S cyclodehydration intermediate docking poses after
    refinement through step 2 of the above description. The top 5 steps as determined by energy
    were returned.
