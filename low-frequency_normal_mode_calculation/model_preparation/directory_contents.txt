File: hmwp2-cy2_pdb_7jtj_model_preprocessing_hbond-opt_and_minimization_before_md.maegz
-	This file contains (in order):
	* The initial PDB 7JTJ pulled from the RCSB PDB
	* The output from preprocessing in the BioLuminate Protein Preparation Wizard (*_preprocessed),
	  which includes hydrogen atoms, charge assignment, correct bond orders, and the missing loop
	  region between alpha helices 5 and 6 as well as the missing side chains modeled using Prime
	  in BioLuminate.
	* Output from hydrogen-bond optimization in the Protein Preparation Wizard (*_hbond-opt)
	* Output from potential energy minimization of hydrogen coordinates in Impact in the Protein
	  Preparation Wizard (*_H-minimized)
	* Output from the potential energy minimziation of all atomic coordinates in Impact in the
	  Protein Preparation Wizard, with the minimization truncated in the step before heavy atom
	  RMSDs reached 0.3 Angstrom (*_H-minimized_-_minimized)
	* A model with the polyethylene glycol (PEG) fragment removed (*_no_peg)
	* A model with distant surface water molecules removed (*_distant_surface_water_removed). This
	  file was used to build the model system for MD simulation.

Directory: desmond_setup_7jtj_10ang_buf_t3p_box_11na_neut/
-	This directory contains files for setup of the initial model system for MD simulation. This
	system was not used in its current state because it still contains the crystallographic
	sodium, which was removed to aid direct comparison between HMWP2-Cy2 results and results
	obtained for other Cy domains that do not contain the sodium.

Directory: desmond_rebuildsystem_7jtj_no_active_site_water_charge_balanced_with_sodium_in_bulk/
-	This directory contains files for "rebuilding" the model system for MD after removal of the
	crystallographic sodium and replacement of a bulk water molecule with a sodium ion to balance
	charge. It also contains the Desmond Solvate Pocket tool input file (*.spd) and the log from
	that run (adding_water_input3.log), which filled water in the alternate upstream tunnel
	entrance and the active site, which had voids following removal of the PEG fragment and the
	crystallographic sodium ion. The output from the Solvate Pocket run is the file ending in
	"-out.cms".

Directory: desmond_md_job_7jtj_no_active_site_na_relaxation_0ns_50kcalmola2_on_protein_heavy
-	This directory contains each stage of the default NPT ensemble relaxation protocol employed
	by Desmond MD in BioLuminate. The set of MD stages in this directory was conducted on NVidia
	GTX980 graphics cards on the Gibbs GPU cluster at the University of Massachusetts Boston.
	Special thanks to Jeff Dusenberry and Runcong Chen of the IT Research Computing staff for
	administering the system and helping get our programs running.
	* Note: the last stage with solute restraints is stage 5, and the run files and output
	  for this stage are in the subdirectory:
	  "desmond_md_job_7jtj_no_active_site_na_relaxation_0ns_50kcalmola2_on_protein_heavy_5"
	  Output from this stage was used in the subsequent stages which gradually release
	  restraints and heat the system.
