HMWP2-PCP1 and HMWP2-PCP2 Model Completion and Sodium Site Evaluation
=====================================================================

The directories below are listed in roughly chronological order of their use in completing the Cy2
model using coordinates from PDB IDs 7JTJ and 7JUA. Included is a .pse for evaluating maps
supporting modeling a sodium ion in the Cy2 tunnel.

Each entry is formatted as:

Directory/File: [Name]
- Description

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

File: metal_site_updated.pse
-   This file contains the crystal structure, maps and measurements used to evaluate the
    crystallographic sodium site.

File: combining_saturn_and_xtal3_models_including_all_compatible_waters_20210722.pse
-   This file contains a PyMOL session used to merge the higher-resolution Cy2 coordinates from 7JTJ
    with the missing loop region between alpha helices 5 and 6 modeled in 7JUA.

Directory: prime_mini_2_full_cy2_A_1513B_1812rot30_R1812-only
-   This directory contains the minimization run performed on the completed Cy2 model with a modified
    rotameric state for R1812. Note that prior to this minimization run, residues with split occupancy
    alternative conformations were selected:
	R1614 B
	Q1675 A
	S1791 A
	Q1813 A
	D1838 A
	N1839 A
    	Q1644 A
	F1513 B
    R1812 of this model was then modified to be in rotameric state 30 using BioLuminate and the model
    was then hydrogen bond optimized including energy minimization of altered hydrogen coordinates.
    All hydrogen coordinates were then refined to minimize potential energy. Water was removed prior
    to the minimization run in this directory. Only coordinates of R1812 were free during this
    minimization.

File: full_cy2_A_1513B_1812rot30.pdb
-   This file contains the coordinates used for the protein-protein docking runs presented in
    the manuscript.
